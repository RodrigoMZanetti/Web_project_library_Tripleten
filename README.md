## Biblioteca Triple Peaks

## Project Overview 📊

Triple Peaks Library is a responsive-style landing page created as the third project in the TripleTen Web Development program. The goal was to practice building a clean multi-section layout using semantic HTML and CSS (Flexbox + positioning), following a provided design brief.

The page includes a header with navigation, a “Staff Picks” section with book cards, an “Events” section with layered visuals, a membership steps section, and a footer with hours and social links.

## Features ✨

• Sticky-like single-page navigation with anchor links to each section (Staff Picks, Events, Membership, Contacts)
• Card-based layout for the “Reader’s Picks” book list
• Events section with layered composition, combining a background image and multiple absolutely positioned people elements
• Step-by-step membership section with consistent spacing and icon usage
• Structured footer with opening hours and social links

## Technologies Used 🛠️

• HTML5 semantic structure (header, main, section, footer)
• CSS Flexbox for layout alignment and spacing
• CSS positioning (relative + absolute) for the events “people” overlay
• Normalize.css for cross-browser consistency
• BEM naming convention for scalable CSS class structure

## Project Structure 🗂️

• index.html, (main, page, markup)
• styles/style.css, (main, stylesheet)
• vendor/normalize.css, (CSS, reset)
• images/, all (SVG and PNG assets)
• favicon.ico, (browser, tab, icon)

## How to Run the Project ▶️

• Download or clone the repository.
• Open index.html in your browser.

Optional (recommended):
• Run a local server (ex: VS Code Live Server) to avoid any path issues and simulate a real environment.

## Project Status 📌

✅ Completed (layout and styling implemented based on the project brief).
Possible next improvements are listed below.

## What I Learned 🧠

• How to build a full landing page using semantic HTML sections
• How to create flexible layouts using Flexbox (alignment, spacing, wrapping, gaps)
• How to use positioning correctly (parent position: relative, children position: absolute) to layer elements
• How BEM helps keep CSS organized and readable as a project grows
• How to structure a project with clear folders (styles, vendor, images)

Next improvements I would add:

• Make the layout responsive (your .page uses min-width: 1100px, so it’s desktop-only right now)
• Add hover/focus states for links and buttons for better UX and accessibility
• Replace href="#" with real URLs or placeholders like https://example.com
• Add language consistency (your page mixes Portuguese + English)
